# Binary Classification Task
### Fun Results:
* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) significantly reduced the problem and made it very simple.
* EDA enabled creation of a 1 line python model was created and achieved the same performance as SVM and logistic regression (85% validation accuracy).
* Simple API (not very needed) was created, can be accessed [here](https://level-unequaled-salto.glitch.me/)
* To use the API, an API key is needed (sent by email)
* Insights into how the data was generated (it was most probably synthetic) and how many variables were created
